# ReliefHub: Localized Disaster Relief Platform

## Project Implementation Plan

## Overview
The platform will consist of two main types of user profiles:
- **Affected Users**: People in need of resources during a disaster (e.g., food, water, medical supplies).
- **Volunteers/Donors**: People who have resources to offer or who can help with distribution.

The main interaction occurs via an interactive map interface that shows the location of users in need and enables direct coordination for supply pick-up and drop-off.

## Core Features

### User Profiles
- **Affected User Profile**:
  - **Personal Information**: Name, location, contact info (email/phone).
  - **Request**: Type of aid needed (food, water, medicine, blankets, etc.), urgency, quantity needed.
  - **Preferred Assistance**: Whether they need supply drop-off, or are able to meet for pickup.
  - **Accessibility Information**: For example, if they are unable to travel or have mobility issues.
  - **Safety Status**: A way to indicate if they are safe or in danger (important for prioritizing aid).
  
- **Volunteer/Donor Profile**:
  - **Personal Information**: Name, location, contact info (email/phone).
  - **Supplies Available**: List of resources they can provide (food, water, first-aid kits, etc.).
  - **Volunteer Role**: Option to indicate if they want to offer supplies, help with transportation, or both.
  - **Availability**: A way to set times they are available to volunteer or drop off supplies.

### Main Map View
- **User Location**: Show a map of the user’s location with a 100-mile radius.
- **Dots for Affected Users**: Each affected user is shown as a dot on the map, with a color code representing the type of aid they need (e.g., blue for water, red for medical supplies).
- **Interaction Options**: Volunteers can click on a dot to view the user’s needs and contact them.
- **Filtered Map Views**: Ability to filter the map to view only specific types of needs (water, food, first-aid, etc.).

### Coordination Mechanisms
- **Contact Methods**: Provide a way for users and volunteers to communicate directly via in-app messaging or through contact details (phone number, email).
- **Supply Meetup Options**: 
  - **Pickup**: Affected user and volunteer can agree to meet at a safe location to hand over supplies.
  - **Drop-off**: The volunteer can drop off supplies at the affected user’s location or a safe nearby spot.
- **Emergency Alerts**: Users can send emergency alerts if they are in urgent need of supplies or help.
  
### User Authentication
- **Sign-Up/Sign-In**: Use email or social login (Google/Facebook) for ease of access.

## Scaling & Future Enhancements Roadmap
- **Verification**: Verification of volunteer/donor profiles could be implemented to ensure trustworthiness (CLEAR Verified API?)
- **Geographical Expansion**: Support for international disasters, multiple languages, and various local volunteer organizations.
- **Donation Integration**: Allow donors to send monetary donations directly to users or relief organizations.
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Implement AI for resource prediction based on historical data and current disaster reports.

## Conclusion
This platform could make a significant difference in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, connecting people who need help with those who can provide it. By leveraging real-time communication, geospatial data, and volunteer coordination, this could be a powerful tool for community relief efforts.
